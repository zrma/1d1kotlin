<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Applications that keep track of our tasks are very practical and handy. In this project, we're going to create one such tool.</p>
<p>We will start with little things. Your program should obtain the tasks from the input, one per line, and then print them. The tasks should contain an index number.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ask for input, by printing <code class="java">Input the tasks (enter a blank line to end):</code>. Read each task, one per line. Get rid of any leading or trailing spaces and tabs;</li>
<li>The tasks input should end when the user inputs a blank line. That is, a line without any text. If a user inputs a line that contains only spaces and tabs, consider it as a blank line.</li>
<li>Print the tasks in the following format:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1  Task1
2  Task2
3  Task3
4  Task4
5  Task5
6  Task6
7  Task7
8  Task8
9  Task9
10 Task10
11 Task11</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The listing of tasks starts with <code class="java">1</code>. The first nine tasks<strong> </strong>contain 2 spaces between the number and the task. Starting from task 10, leave only one space (see the Examples section);</li>
<li>If users don't input any tasks (a blank line), print <code class="java">No tasks have been input</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>normal execution</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input the tasks (enter a blank line to end):
&gt; Dentist on 15/1
&gt; Present for friend birthday
&gt; Supermarket. Milk, eggs, butter.
&gt;
1  Dentist on 15/1
2  Present for friend birtday
3  Supermarket. Milk, eggs, butter.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> <em>normal execution with 10 or more tasks</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input the tasks (enter a blank line to end):
