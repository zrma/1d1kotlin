<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Lightweight branches are known as one of the best features of Git. In Git, a branch is just one commit object like the one you parsed in stage 3! Branches do not contain any duplicates of other branches.</p>
<p>The list of your local branches is typically stored in the <code class="java">.git/refs/heads</code> directory. The file names in this folder are equal to branch names. The content in these files is equal to the commit ID of the head of the corresponding branch.</p>
<p>The current HEAD is stored in the <code class="java">.git/HEAD</code> file.</p>
<p>ORIG_HEAD contains the last HEAD you worked on if you are currently in a “detached head” state.</p>
<p>The list of available branches can be accessed with the <code class="java">git branch -l</code> command.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Extend your program with command names. Use the <code class="java">cat-file</code> command name for <code class="java">git-object</code> file printing.</p>
<p>Add the <code class="java">list-branches</code> command. This new command should print out local branch names accessible in the  <code class="java">/refs/heads</code> directory of the specified <code class="java">.git</code> location. The branch list should be sorted in alphabetical order. Branch names should be preceded with <code class="java">*</code> followed by one space for the current branch and two spaces for other branches.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space <code class="java">&gt; </code>  represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter .git directory location:

Enter command:
&gt; list-branches

  feature2
* master</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Enter .git directory location:
