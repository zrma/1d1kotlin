  message: |-
    <html>string -> there is no such type as a string (with lowercase s)
    Int -> right-hand side is a String literal thus left side type should be String, not Int
    var -> var is a keyword to declare variables not types
    String -> correct
    Char -> right-hand side is not a character but a String
    remove : and ____ and let Kotlin use Type Inference to figure out the type for us</html>
