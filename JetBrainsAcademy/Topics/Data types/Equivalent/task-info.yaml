  message: |-
    <html>val age: Int = 42  // this is correct for integer type not a String type
    Int age = 42  // invalid Kotlin syntax
    val age = “42”: String  // invalid syntax, colon, and type should come right after the value name
    String age = “42”  // valid in Java but not in Kotlin
    var age = 42  // var is used here not val, and age is of type Int, not a String
    val age: String = “42”  // correct syntax, although not mandatory we can explicitly declare the type
    val age: Char = ‘42’  // '42' is not Char type, in fact, it is not a valid type Kotlin knows about</html>
