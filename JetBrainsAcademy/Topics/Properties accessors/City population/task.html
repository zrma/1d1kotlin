<h2>City population</h2>
<p>Imagine we want to implement the <code class="java">City</code> class which stores the name of the city and its population.</p>

<p>There are some restrictions. If the number is out of range, the population is corrected like this: zero for negative values and 50 million for greater than <code class="java">50_000_000</code>.</p>

<p>Finish the implementation of the <code class="java">City</code> class following this logic.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
