  <p>There are two 2D vectors. Find the angle between them. Its value has to be in<strong> degrees</strong>.</p> 
  <p>If you don't know how to find the angle, please refer to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-Angle-Between-Two-Vectors" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-Angle-Between-Two-Vectors">the Wikihow instruction</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input data format</strong></p> 
  <p>The first line contains two values of the first vector, the second line contains two values of the second vector. Values in one line are separated by a space.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output data format</strong></p> 
  <p>One fractional value: an angle between two vectors. You may not round it, it's up to you.</p>
