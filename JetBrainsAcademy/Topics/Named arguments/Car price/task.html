  <p>Peter wants to know how much his car costs on the second-hand market. Lucky for him, there is a special site that can tell the price. When he opened the site, all the parameters of his car were filled with default values, and it happened to be that all parameters except one matched the parameters of Peter's car. So, he changed only one parameter and clicked OK. Wasn't that cool?</p> 
  <p>Imagine you are the developer that needs to <strong>create the same logic</strong> using a <strong>function</strong>. The function should take parameters: how <strong>old</strong> a car is, how many <strong>kilometers</strong> this car passed, the <strong>maximum speed</strong>, and whether this car has <strong>automatic transmission</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The default arguments for this model are: 5<strong> </strong>years old, ran 100000<em> </em>km, have a maximum speed of 120<strong> </strong>kilometers per hour (km/h), no automatic transmission. The initial price of a new car with the default equipment is 20000$.</p> 
  <p>The function should work like this:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Every year the price of the car decreases by 2000$.</li> 
   <li>The price goes down by 100$<strong> </strong>for every kilometer per hour less than 120 km/h<strong> </strong>and increases by 100$<strong> </strong>for every kilometer per hour greater than 120<em> </em>km/h.</li> 
   <li>The price lowers by 200$<strong> </strong>for every 10000<strong> </strong>kilometers that the car passed. For example, for 19999 km, the price decreases by 200 dollars, but for 20000 km the price lowers by 400 dollars.</li> 
   <li>If the car has automatic transmission, the price of the car goes up by 1500$, otherwise, it remains the same.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The function should print the price of the car is on the second-hand market.</p>
