  <p>Write the class <code class="java">IceCreamOrder</code> that has one <code class="java">Int</code> property: <code class="java">price</code>. The class must have two secondary constructors.</p> 
  <p>The first one takes one <code class="java">Int</code> argument: <code class="java">popsicles</code>, which signifies the number of popsicles the customer wants. The price is calculated as 7 currency units per popsicle.</p> 
  <p>The second constructor takes two <code class="java">Int</code> arguments: <code class="java">scoops</code> and <code class="java">toppings</code>, which signifies the number of ice cream scoops and the number of different toppings that the customer wants in the order. The price is calculated as 5 currency units per scoop plus 2 currency units per topping.</p> 
  <p>Note, code style checker may prompt you to use a <a target="_blank" href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/8526" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">data class</a>. This is a convenient way to create a class with some basic functionality and we will discuss it later. Until then, try to practice using the secondary constructor!</p>
