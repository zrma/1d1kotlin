<h2>Secondary constructor</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>You already know how to work with primary constructors. However, they have their limitations. For example, you may need to create several different constructors for the same class but you can't do that with a primary constructor alone. That's where secondary, or custom, constructors come in handy.</p> 
  <h5>Custom constructor</h5> 
  <p>You can declare <strong>custom constructors</strong> for a class along with a primary constructor or without one.</p> 
  <p>To declare a secondary constructor, write the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code> inside the class body and parentheses with the constructor's parameters after the keyword. Then, put curly braces with the constructor logic inside:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Now you can create objects in one line, just as if you were using a primary constructor:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(3, 4)
val size2 = Size(5, 1)</code></pre> 
  <p>Be careful: you have to either use an implicit constructor or declare your own, but you cannot use both at the same time:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }
}

val size = Size() // Error! No values passed for parameters _width and _height</code></pre> 
  <p>What you can do is create a replica of the default constructor explicitly (empty curly braces can be removed):</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">// preferable solution
class Size() { 
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0
}

// or this way

class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor() {
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <h5>Multiple constructors</h5> 
  <p>Creating several constructors for a class is almost as simple as creating just one, but there is a particular constraint you need to keep in mind. Every secondary constructor has to have a unique signature. You cannot use the same signature for the primary or any other constructor.</p> 
  <p>The constructor signature consists of the number, the types, and the order of the parameters. To create a valid constructor, you need to make sure it has a unique list of parameters. As an example, look at the following constructors for the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(_height: Int) {
        height = _height
    }

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height
    }

    constructor(_width: Int, _height: Double) {
        width = _width
        height = _height.toInt()
    }

    constructor(_height: Double, _width: Int) {
        width = _width
        height = _height.toInt()
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>The code below will create four <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> objects with the same property values using different constructors:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val size1 = Size(7) // uses 1st constructor
val size2 = Size(0,7) // uses 2nd constructor
val size3 = Size(0, 7.0) // uses 3rd constructor
val size4 = Size(7.0, 0) // uses 4th constructor</code></pre> 
  <p>Remember that signatures are defined by the types of the parameters, not by their names. For example, the compiler can not tell these two constructors apart, even if they look different for a person:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {}
constructor(x: Int, y: Int) {}</code></pre> 
  <p>So, implemented in the same class, these constructors will cause an error.</p> 
  <h5><code class="language-kotlin">this</code> keyword</h5> 
  <p>Inside the class code, you can also access the object members using a special keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> that represents the current object.</p> 
  <p>For example, you can use it to name the constructor parameters the same as the class properties. Let's change the class <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    var width: Int = 0
    var height: Int = 0

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>In the code above, you will get an error without the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code>, since the names will be interpreted as the immutable constructor parameters and not the class members.</p> 
  <h5>Omitting default values</h5> 
  <p>As you remember, if a property value is assigned in the constructor, you don't have to provide a default value:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size (var width: Int, var height: Int) {
    // whatever you want
}</code></pre> 
  <p>This is also true for secondary construction. Let's change <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> to <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> in the <code class="language-kotlin">Size</code> class so the properties cannot be reassigned. For the sake of demonstration, let's add another property <code class="language-kotlin">area</code> that will be calculated based on the constructor parameters:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    val width: Int
    val height: Int
    val area: Int

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int) {
        this.width = width
        this.height = height
        this.area = width * height
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>It looks like a reassignment, but you are just initializing the values, so nothing wrong.</p> 
  <p>Note that you cannot use the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> keywords in the secondary constructor.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size {
    constructor(val width: Int, val height: Int) { // error, val is not allowed
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <h5>Constructors delegation</h5> 
  <p>If a class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to call the primary one, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s). This is called <strong>delegation</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done with the keyword <code class="language-kotlin">this</code> placed after the constructor arguments and before the constructor body:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    var area: Int = width * height

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int, outerSize: Size) : this(width, height) {
        outerSize.area -= this.area
        println("Updated outer object's area is equal to ${outerSize.area}")
    }
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Delegation to the primary constructor becomes the first statement of a secondary constructor, so the properties are initialized before the secondary constructor code is executed. Initializer blocks, if present, are also executed before the secondary constructor. If a class has no primary constructor, the delegation happens implicitly.</p> 
  <h5>Constructor execution</h5> 
  <p>Let's look at the example and see in which order the class code is executed:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Size(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
    var area: Int = width * height

    init {
        println("Object with area equal to $area is created")
    }

    constructor(width: Int, height: Int, outerSize: Size) : this(width, height) {
        outerSize.area -= this.area
        println("Updated outer object's area is equal to ${outerSize.area}")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val outerObject = Size(5, 8)
    val innerObject = Size(2, 3, outerObject)
}</code></pre> 
  <p>When creating <code class="language-kotlin">outerObject</code>, the primary constructor is directly called, the properties are initialized and the <code class="language-kotlin">init</code> block is executed. In case of <code class="language-kotlin">innerObject</code>, the secondary constructor first calls the primary, the properties initialization and the initialization block happen, and finally, the secondary constructor code is executed.</p> 
  <p>It results in the following output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Object with area equal to 40 is created
Object with area equal to 6 is created
Updated outer object's area is equal to 34</code></pre>
