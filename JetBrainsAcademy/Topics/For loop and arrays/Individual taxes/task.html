  <p>There are N companies in a country. The laws of this country say that the taxes of each company are appointed by the President. The President wants to know which company pays the highest taxes. However, none of the President's advisers know math well enough, so they asked for your help. Can you solve this problem?<br> <br> The first line of the input contains the number of companies in this country.<br> The next N lines contain the annual income of each company. The numbers are non-negative integers.<br> The last N lines contain taxes for each company, that is, the percentage of the company's income.</p> 
  <p>All numbers are integers from 0 to 100.<br> <br> Output the number of the company that pays the most taxes. Keep in mind that the enumeration of the companies starts from 1. If there are several companies with the same taxes, output the number of the company with the lower number.</p>
