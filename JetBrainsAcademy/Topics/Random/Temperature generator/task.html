  <p>Imagine that you were tasked with measuring the water temperature in the aquarium for a week. Unfortunately, you forgot about it and now you need to fake a temperature journal. The normal temperature in the aquarium ranges from 20 to 30 degrees (inclusive).</p> 
  <p>Write a function that gets a seed and returns a string with 7 numbers from 20 to 30 on one line. For example: <code class="java">20 26 21 30 27 23 25</code></p>
