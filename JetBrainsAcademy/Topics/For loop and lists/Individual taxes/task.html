<h2>Individual taxes</h2>
<p></p>
<p>There are N companies in the country. The laws of this country say that the tax of each company is decided by the President. The President wants to know which company pays the highest tax. However, none of the President's advisers know math well enough, so they asked for your help. Can you solve this problem?<br/>
<br/>
The first line of the input contains the number of companies in this country.<br/>
The next N lines contain the annual income of each company. The numbers are non-negative integers.<br/>
The last N lines contain the tax rate for each company, that is, the percentage of the company's income.</p>
<p>The tax value is the company's annual income multiplied by the tax rate.</p>
<p>For inputs, use integers from 0 to 100.<br/>
<br/>
Output the number of the company that pays the largest tax. Keep in mind that the enumeration of the companies starts from 1. If there are several companies with the same tax, choose the one entered first.</p>
