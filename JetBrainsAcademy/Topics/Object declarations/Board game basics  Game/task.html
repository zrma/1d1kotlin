<h2>Board game basics: Game</h2>
<p></p>
<p>You want to create a game and you decided to store the playing field in a <code class="java">PlayingField</code> singleton. Inside this object, you added a <code class="java">Size</code> singleton to store the field dimensions. This is a 2D game, so this object has the properties <code class="java">width</code> and <code class="java">height</code>.</p>
<p>Your field size can change, so you need to be able to resize it. For this, you decided to create the <code class="java">changeSize()</code> function inside the <span style="color: #000000;"><code class="java">PlayingField</code> object</span>. Complete this function!</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
