<h2>Blocks in a box</h2>

  <p>Let's create a simple class with a nested object. There is a box of blocks for kids. All of them are the same size but their colors can be different. We will store these objects in a class <code class="java">Block</code> with one property <code class="java">color</code> and a nested object <code class="java">BlockProperties</code> with properties <span style="color: #000000;"><code class="java">length</code> </span>and <code class="java">width</code>. Your task is to create this structure!</p> 
  <p>In addition, your nested object should have a <code class="java">blocksInBox()</code> function that receives the length and width (parameters order is important) of a box and returns the amount of blocks this box can store.</p> 
  <p>Make the properties of a nested object mutable for the validation system! You may initialize them with any numbers, for example, 6 and 4. as in the example. Don't worry about heights, solve it like a 2D problem. Don't rotate the blocks.</p>

  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-1098').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-1098" style="display:none;">
    Don't forget about the order of precedence! (9/4) * (14/6) = 4 but (9*14) / (6*4) = 5 
  </div>
