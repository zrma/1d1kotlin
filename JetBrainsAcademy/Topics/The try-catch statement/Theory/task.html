<h2>The try-catch statement</h2>

 <body>
  <p>As you already know, an exception interrupts normal execution of a program. Normally, this is not what we want to happen. Good news is, it is possible to write code that will handle exceptions without stopping the whole program.</p> 
  <p>To do that, Kotlin has the <strong>exception handling</strong> mechanism. After a line of code throws an exception, Kotlin attempts to find a suitable handler for it. Such a handler can be located in the same method where the exception occurred or in the calling method. As soon as a suitable handler is found and executed, the exception is considered handled and the program runs normally.</p> 
  <p>In this topic, we will learn about two keywords for handling exceptions: <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code>.</p> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">The try-catch statement</h5> 
  <p>Here is a simple <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch</code> template for handling exceptions:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} catch (e: SomeException) {
    // code for handling the exception
}</code></pre> 
  <p>The <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block is used to wrap the code that may throw an exception. This block can include all lines of code, including method calls.</p> 
  <p>The <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block is a handler for the specified type of exception and all its subtypes. This block is executed when an exception of the corresponding type occurs in the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block. </p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
   Note that the specified type in the 
   <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block must be an exception.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>In the presented template, the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block can handle exceptions of the <code class="language-kotlin">Exception</code> type and all types derived from it.</p> 
  <p>The following example demonstrates the execution flow with <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">println("Before the try-catch block") // it will be printed
try {
    println("Inside the try block before an exception") // it will be printed
    println(2 / 0) // it throws ArithmeticException
    println("Inside the try block after the exception") // it won't be printed
} 
catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
    println("Division by zero!") // it will be printed
}

println("After the try-catch block") // it will be printed</code></pre> 
  <p>The output:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Before the try-catch block
Inside the try block before an exception
Division by zero!
After the try-catch block</code></pre> 
  <p>The program does not print <code class="language-kotlin">"Inside the try block after the exception"</code> since the <code class="language-kotlin">ArithmeticException</code> aborted the normal flow of execution. Instead, it executes the print statement in the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block. After the completion of the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block, the program executes the next statement (printing <code class="language-kotlin">"After the try-catch block"</code>) without returning to the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block again.</p> 
  <p>Replacing <code class="language-kotlin">Exception</code> with <code class="language-kotlin">ArithmeticException</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">RuntimeException</code> in the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> statement does not change the execution flow of the program. But replacing it, for instance, with <code class="language-kotlin">NumberFormatException</code> will make the handler unsuitable for the exception and the program will fail.</p> 
  <p>Pay attention! The variables announced in the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block will only be available in the block: you can't work with it neither outside nor in the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block.</p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   If the result of the execution of the 
   <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block throws an exception not foreseen in the 
   <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> expression, the program will fail despite all precautions.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">Getting info about exceptions</h5> 
  <p>When an exception is caught by the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block, it is possible to get some information on it. To do this, we use <code class="language-kotlin">message</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    val d = (2 / 0).toDouble()
} 
catch (e: Exception) {
    println(e.message)
}</code></pre> 
  <p>This code prints:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">/ by zero</code></pre> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">Catching multiple exceptions</h5> 
  <p>It is always possible to use a single handler for all types of exceptions:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    // code that may throw exceptions
} 
catch (e: Exception) {
    println("Something goes wrong")
}</code></pre> 
  <p>Obviously, this approach does not allow us to perform different actions depending on the type of exception that has occurred. Fortunately, Kotlin supports the use of several handlers inside the same <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    // code that throws exceptions
}
catch (e: IOException) {
    // handling the IOException and its subtypes   
}
catch (e: Exception) {
    // handling the Exception and its subtypes
}</code></pre> 
  <p>You can add as many <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> blocks as you need. When an exception occurs in the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block, the runtime system determines the first suitable <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block according to the type of the exception; matching goes from top to down. </p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-warning">
   The 
   <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block with the base type has to be written below all the blocks with subtypes. In other words, more specialized handlers (like 
   <code class="language-kotlin">IOException</code>) must be written before the more general ones (like 
   <code class="language-kotlin">Exception</code>). Otherwise, the block with the subtype will be ignored. 
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">Where and how to handle an exception</h5> 
  <p>Technically, an exception can be handled in the method where it occurs or in the calling method. The best approach to handle an exception is to do it in a method that has sufficient information to make the correct decision based on this exception.</p> 
  <p>So, why should we throw out specific types of exceptions when there is a general <code class="language-kotlin">Exception</code> that includes all possible cases and is always appropriate? Well, keep in mind that your colleagues or maybe even yourself in a couple of weeks may not really know whatâ€™s going on in the code. It would be best for you to provide as much information as possible. This will make handling exceptions much easier.</p> 
  <p>Always try to find the exception type that fits best to your exceptional event, for instance, throw a <code class="language-kotlin">NumberFormatException</code> instead of just an <code class="language-kotlin">Exception</code>. </p> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5> 
  <p>Let's recap: the <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch</code> statement is used for exception handling. The <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block contains the actions that can potentially cause the exception. The <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block is executed if an exception occurs. Now, let's practice!</p>
