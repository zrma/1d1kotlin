  <p><em>“The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem. Do you understand?” – Jack Sparrow</em></p> 
  <p>This code prints the name of the current captain of the ship (now, it is Hector's name). </p> 
  <p>However, the crew re-elected the captain, and now it's Jack Sparrow.</p> 
  <p><strong>Fix </strong>the declaration of the <code class="java">captain</code> variable, create a new <code class="java">Pirate</code> object, assign the variable <code class="java">captain</code> to a new value, and print the name of the current captain again.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p> 
  <p>Hector Barbossa</p> 
  <p>Jack Sparrow</p>
