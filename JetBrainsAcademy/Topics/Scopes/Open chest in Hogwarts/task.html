<h2>Open chest in Hogwarts</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry has a teacher whom the students call Mad-Eye. Now, Barty Crouch is hiding under this name. However, the real Mad-Eye's name is Alastor Moody, and now he is hidden in the chest!</p>
<p>In the code below, there is a function <code class="java">openChest</code>, which should assign a real name to the <code class="java">madEye</code> variable. However, this function does not work now. Change code <strong>only</strong> in this function to make renaming work for the top-level variable <code class="java">madEye</code>.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
