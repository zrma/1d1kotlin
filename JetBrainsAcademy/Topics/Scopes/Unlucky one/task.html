<h2>Unlucky one</h2>

 <body>
  <p>You have a variable named <code class="java">unlucky</code>. Now its scope is the <code class="java">main()</code> function.</p> 
  <p>Redefine <code class="java">unlucky</code> so that it becomes a top-level variable with a scope one level higher.</p> 
  <p>______________________</p> 
  <p><em>This is usually not a good idea. However, the task is needed to understand what a top-level variable is.</em></p>
