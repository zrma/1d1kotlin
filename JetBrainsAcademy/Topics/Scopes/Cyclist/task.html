<h2>Cyclist</h2>
<p></p><p>While training, a cyclist rides the same road to and from. Now his distance controller is not working: there is an error in the controller code, and the road back is calculated incorrectly.</p><p>The variable <code class="java">distance</code> contains the last distance traveled in one direction. If the cyclist is riding back, the <code class="java">distance</code> variable must be negative. To calculate the total distance traveled, the negative <code class="java">distance</code> must be inverted and then added to the <code class="java">totalDistance</code> variable. However, for some reason, the code does not work now.</p><p>Fix the code below to make it work.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">-10<br>30</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">40</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
