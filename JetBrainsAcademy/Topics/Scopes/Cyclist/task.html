  <p>While training, a cyclist rides the same road to and from. Now his distance controller is not working: there is an error in the controller code, and the road back is calculated incorrectly.</p> 
  <p>The variable <code class="java">distance</code> contains last distance traveled in one direction. If the cyclist is riding back, the <code class="java">distance</code> variable must be negative. To calculate the total distance traveled, negative <code class="java">distance</code> must be inverted and then added to the <code class="java">totalDistance</code> variable. However, for some reason, the code does not work now.</p> 
  <p>Fix the code below to make it work.</p>
